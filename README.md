# Hangman in Typescript

This is a simple Hangman game built with Typescript and Vite.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js installed, you can close the
repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sprial404/hangman-typescript-vite.git
cd hangman-typescript-vite
yarn install
```

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```
This will start the server. The URL to access the app will be printed to the
console, and should look something like this: `http://localhost:1234`.

The development server will automatically reload the page when changes are made
to the code.

## Preview

To preview the production build locally, run:

```bash
yarn build
yarn preview
```

This will build the app and start a local server. The URL to access the app
will be printed to the console, and should look something like this:
`http://localhost:4321`.

## Build

To build the production-ready version of the app, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the compiled HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
